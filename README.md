# Getting and cleaning data
One of the most developing areas right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

Here, data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone was retrieved and cleaned, to get a tidy dataset.

## This repository contains the following files:

* README.md, describes the dataset and the project.
* tidy_data.txt, which contains the tidy dataset.
* CodeBook.md, describes the contents of the dataset.
* run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set
